A Justification Runner designed for jPipe.

## Features

- Fully compatible with existing jPipe syntax/grammar.
- A keyword-driven operational justification diagram.

## Motivation

In the current Justification Diagram of [jPipe](https://github.com/ace-design/jpipe), the primary focus is on describing
_what justification_ to perform and the _reasoning relationship_ between justification and conclusion. However, it does
not elaborate on _how_ to actually execute these justifications in code, resulting in .jd files that are mainly a visual
representation of reasoning â€” **lacking the capacity to run the justification process** in practice.

In contrast, [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework) is a generic automation framework for
acceptance testing. It uses a simple plain-text syntax and can be extended with various libraries.

- It maps the "keyword" that appears in the test case to a Python (or other language) function for execution.
- This allows the "verification function" to be called directly when writing the test script and get the execution
  result (Pass/Fail), thus enabling an executable test/verification process.

**Inspired by Robot Framework's keyword-driven approach**, we propose to implement a jpipe-runner to make the jPipe
Justification Diagram executable and operational. With this extension, each _justification evidence/strategy_ could be
mapped to corresponding executable code, transforming jPipe from a purely visual reasoning tool into a fully automated
CI/CD-style justification framework.
